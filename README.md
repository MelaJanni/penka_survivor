# PENKA SURVIVOR

Football survivor league app built with Flutter. Pick your winning team each matchday, lose lives if you're wrong, and survive until you're the last one standing to take home the entire prize pool.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed (if you don't have it, get it from https://flutter.dev)
- Backend running on `localhost:4300` with survivor endpoints

### 2. Clone and Run
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd penka_survivor

```

### 3. That's it!

## How to Play

1. **Join a league**
2. **Make your pick** - Choose which team will win each matchday
3. **Wait for results** - If your team loses, you lose a life; if they tie, you lose half a life
4. **Survive** - Last player with the most lives takes the entire prize pool
